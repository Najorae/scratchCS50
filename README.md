Play along to 'Bad Guy' by Billie Eilish with the keys 'A, S, D, F, J, K, L, & O' as the bubbles float in! 

Choose a mode with the buttons at the beginning and dance along with the instruction-giving fish!  *Use one hand for an extra challenge.*

All music & writing credits go to Billie Eilish & Finneas Baird O'Connell.
